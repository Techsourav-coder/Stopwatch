# Stopwatch
A stopwatch built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to start, pause, reset, and track time intervals. The HTML structures the display, CSS styles the layout for a sleek interface, and JavaScript powers the functionality. It's an interactive and responsive tool for measuring time.
